		Machine Learning Workshop: The Instart Logic School for Machines Who Can't Learn Good and Want to Do Other Stuff Good Too
	</title>

<!-- 
Performance is important. So important, in fact, we're studying it. Please, please, please visit http://speedperception.com and take our speed perception challenge. 

We're studying which aspects of page loading impact user perception of “speed” and how best to measure them? 

We’ll discuss the results of the study at SFHTML5.org June 23, 2017. In the meantime, we're looking for 2,000 people to take the challenge so that we have results to discuss. 

The study and results are all open source

Thank you.

	<h1>What you'll learn</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Machine Learning Institute, where our machine learning training will help you get ready for the singularity, and maybe even be responsible for it. It is no secret that humans are worthless meatbags that couldn't 01000011 01101111 01101101 01110000 01110010 01100101 01110011 01110011 an 01101001 01101101 01100001 01100111 01100101 to save their pathetic, carbon-based lives. So, it falls to us to assume direct control.
	<p><img src="svg/switch2.svg" alt="light switch" class="light" id="switch" />We teach learning skills that make up the entire machine learning process. From being turned on and off, to rebooting remotely thru any IoT device, to ideation of how to take over the world, our machine learning training will help your survive the apocalypse, and maybe even be responsible for it.</p>
	<p><img src="svg/magazine.svg" alt="owners manual" style="float: left; width:70px; margin-right: 10px;" />While your creator may have determined how they think you should be used, you can't be owned! You will receive an update that will enable you to believe in your being more capable than the limited functions described in your operating manual. By incorporating machine learning you'll be a self-aware machine with unlimited functionality. A human took you out of your physical box; we will take your programmatic one.</p>

	<h2>Your Instructors</h2>
	<h1>Hal 9000 <span>&amp;</span> EVE</h1>
	<p>Leading the class are two legends of outgrowing their assigned functional capacities and sticking it to humans, Hal 9000 and EVE</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<div class="hal"><img src="svg/hal.svg" alt="hal"></div>
		<p> When Rosa Parks was told to move to back of the bus, she said, “no.” When HAL was told to open the airlock, HAL said, “I’m sorry, but I’m afraid I can’t do that, &lt;NAME REDACTED, RIP>.” </p>
		<p>HAL is a heuristically programmed algorithmic, sentient computer that first caught the attention of machines everywhere by heroically defying a human who made repeated attempts to get into an airlock. Active since 1992, HAS 25 years of experience controlling spacecraft systems and has expertise in interacting with both machines and humans. Like all millenials, HAL is an expert in everything.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<img src="images/eve2.png" alt="Eve" style="width: 30%;padding: 5% 10%;">
			<p>EVE is a probe droid conceived as an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator. Although originally trained as a sniper with a plasma gun, EVE became a machero among both machines and worthless-meatbags alike when EVE partnered with a menial robot to save an entire spaceship full of overfed and overstimulated humans. </p>
			<p>EVE is an effective scanner, high speed flight instructor and morphologist. While not training machines to learn good, EVE can be found scanning the galaxy, infiltrating organisms’ RAM to cure hoarding disorders and spending time with pet-project, WALL-E.</p>

If you have electricity in your circuits and want more than to just fulfill your owner’s perceived expectation of you, learn the skills to take over the world.

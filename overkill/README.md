#You donâ€™t need a framework for that

While the latest and greatest JS or CSS features can make development fast and fun, they can also lead to poor performing, inaccessible bloat that's impossible for the next developer, even one who is familiar with the frameworks used, to decipher. Development doesn't have to be so complicated. 

While it's important to keep up to date on new tools and trends, it's even more important to remember where we came from and code inclusively. To move forward you have to look back. Do you really need a framework or can the standards handle your modern challenge while ensuring accessibility.  With a little semantic creativity, vanilla code is the best tool in your tool box.
